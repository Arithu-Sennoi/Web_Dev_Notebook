Note that this is not the right way to start a react project. This is just to get an understand of it. 
```html
<script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react@17/umd/react.development.js"></script>

<script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@17/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>

<script src="https://unpkg.com/babel-standalone@6/babel.min.js"></script>
```
Put above script tags in header section. 
Then connect your js file like this:
```html
<script type="text/babel" src="test.js"></script>
```
