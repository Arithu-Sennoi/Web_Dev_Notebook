```js
const ourStr = "I come first. " + "I come second.";
```
The output: I come first. I come second. 

You can add 2 strings with a plus. 

```js
let ourStr = "I come first. ";
ourStr += "I come second.";
```
We can use += operator to concatenate a string at the end of another string. 

Sometimes you will need to build a string. By using the concatenation operator (+), you can insert one or more variables into a string you're building.

Example:

```js
const ourName = "freeCodeCamp";
const ourStr = "Hello, our name is " + ourName + ", how are you?";
```

We can also add one string variable to another string variable. 
```js
const anAdjective = "awesome!";
let ourStr = "freeCodeCamp is ";
ourStr += anAdjective;
```
