Modules are a way to easily share code among JavaScript files. You can split JavaScript programs into multiple modules that can be imported when needed. 

JS modules use `import` and `export` statements. 

In order to use module functionality, you need to create a script in HTML document, with a type of module.
```html
<script type="module" scr="filename.js"></script>
```
This script can now import and export features.
