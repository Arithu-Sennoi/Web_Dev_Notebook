Math functions in javascript:
```javascript
x = Math.round(x);
x = Math.floor(x);
x = Math.ceil(x);
x = Math.pow(x, 2);
x = Math.sqrt(x);
x = Math.abs(x);
x = Math.max(a, b, c);
x = Math.min(a, b, x);
x = Math.PI;
```

- .round() rounds down the number to nearest interger. 
- .floor() is a floor function from maths, it gives nearest integer that is less than or equal to the given number. 
- .ceil() is a ceiling function from maths, it gives nearest integer that is greater than or equal to the given number. 
- .pow(x, 2) raises x to the power of 2. 
- sqrt(x) gives square root of x. 
- abs is like modulus function from maths. 
- max() and min() give maximum and minimum values from given values. 
- math.PI gives value of pi upto 15 decimal digits.
