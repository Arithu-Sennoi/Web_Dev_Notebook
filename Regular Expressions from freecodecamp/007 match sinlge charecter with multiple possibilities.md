You learned how to match literal patterns (`/literal/`) and wildcard character (`/./`). Those are the extremes of regular expressions, where one finds exact matches and the other matches everything. There are options that are a balance between the two extremes.

You can search for a literal pattern with some flexibility with character classes. Character classes allow you to define a group of characters you wish to match by placing them inside square (`[` and `]`) brackets.

For example, you want to match `bag`, `big`, and `bug` but not `bog`. You can create the regex `/b[aiu]g/` to do this. The `[aiu]` is the character class that will only match the characters `a`, `i`, or `u`.

```js
let bigStr = "big";
let bagStr = "bag";
let bugStr = "bug";
let bogStr = "bog";
let bgRegex = /b[aiu]g/;
bigStr.match(bgRegex);
bagStr.match(bgRegex);
bugStr.match(bgRegex);
bogStr.match(bgRegex);
```

In order, the four `match` calls would return the values `["big"]`, `["bag"]`, `["bug"]`, and `null`.

You can use "or" operator to match several stuff, but then you would have to type more. By using Charecter classes, you can do it easily. 

```js
let quoteSample = "Beware of bugs in the above code; I have only proved it correct, not tried it.";
let vowelRegex = /[aeiou]/ig; 
let result = quoteSample.match(vowelRegex); 
console.log(result);
```
This code finds all vowels in the string and outputs then in the console.
