HTML elements have opening tags like `<h1>` and closing tags like `</h1>`.

The text for an element goes between its opening and closing tags.

h1 h2 h3 are all headings. 

```html
<h1>HELLO WORLD</h1>
```

most html tags have opening and closing tags. 


The `h1` through `h6` heading elements are used to signify the importance of content below them. The lower the number, the higher the importance, so `h2` elements have less importance than `h1` elements. Only use one `h1` element per page and place lower importance headings below higher importance headings.
