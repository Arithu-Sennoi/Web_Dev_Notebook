gradient is when one color transitions into another. The CSS `linear-gradient` function lets you control the direction of the transition along a line, and which colors are used.

The `linear-gradient` function is very flexible -- here is a basic syntax:

```css
linear-gradient(gradientDirection, color1, color2, ...);
```

`gradientDirection` is the direction of the line used for the transition. `color1` and `color2` are color arguments, which are the colors that will be used in the transition itself. These can be any type of color, including color keywords, hex, `rgb`, or `hsl`.

Color-stops allow you to fine-tune where colors are placed along the gradient line. They are a length unit like `px` or percentages that follow a color in the `linear-gradient` function.
For example, in this red-black gradient, the transition from red to black takes place at the 90% point along the gradient line, so red takes up most of the available space:

```css
.button {
background: linear-gradient(90deg, red 90%, black);
}
```
